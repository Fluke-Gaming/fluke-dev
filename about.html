                <p>Who we are, and what we're all about.</p>

                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Our group was established by a handful of WoW players who continued playing together through multiple expansions, different game trends, and life changes. We've been together since 2010, and we're still going strong!</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>The Community</h2>
                    <p>Our members are primarily adults who make time for gaming despite our busy schedules. Since we only have limited time to spend together, we make sure that real-world drama doesn't intrude in our conversations.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Group Activities</h2>
                    <p>While most of us play WoW together, we also host a number of other gaming opportunities. Many of us play MTG, and we often launch private gaming servers that have included Rust, Abiotic Factor, 7 Days, Enshrouded, etc.</p>
