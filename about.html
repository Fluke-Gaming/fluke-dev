          <p>
            Fluke Gaming began in 2010 with a small group of World of Warcraft players who continued playing together through multiple expansions, industry trends, and real-life changes. What started as a raid team evolved into a long-term community.

          <h2 class="content-block__title">The Community</h2>
          <p>
            Most members are adults balancing work, families, and limited gaming time. Because of that, we value mutual respect, maturity, and low-drama interactions. We treat gaming as something we look forward to, not something that creates stress.

          <h2 class="content-block__title">Group Activities</h2>
          <p>
            While World of Warcraft remains our primary game, we also organize Magic: The Gathering nights and spin up private servers for different multiplayer games. So far this has included titles such as Rust, 7 Days to Die, Enshrouded, and more.
